# How to Fold a Paper Air Plane

## Material 
* White 8.5x11'' Printer Paper
* Paperclip *(optional)*

## Methods
* Take paper and fold it in half the long way so you have a 4.25x11'' rectangle
* Fold the corners on one end down so they touch the crease on the inside of the first fold and two right triangles that make a point on the front end of the paper air plane.
* Make a second fold on top of triangles you already have by taking the outside of the triangle and folding it to the cental crease. You should end up with a pointier front end.
* Crease all folds and hold the paper so that all fold are inside the paper.
* Fold down a flap from the pointy end to the back of the plane so that the flaps in flush with the botton of the plane on both sides
* Open up flaps so that they form a flat top of the plane. It is now ready to fly.
* Additionally you can put a paperclip on the bottom of the pointy end to make it fly further.
